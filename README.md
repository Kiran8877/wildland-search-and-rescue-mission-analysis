Wildland Search and Rescue Missions Analysis – Power BI Dashboard
📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes Wildland Search and Rescue (SAR) missions conducted by NYS Forest Rangers (2012–2025) using Microsoft Power BI. The dashboard provides actionable insights into mission trends, high-risk activities, subject demographics, geographic distribution, and resource utilization to support data-driven emergency response planning.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze SAR mission trends across years

Identify high-risk outdoor activities

Study subject demographics and geographic patterns

Evaluate ranger deployment and mission duration

Enable interactive exploration using Power BI visuals
